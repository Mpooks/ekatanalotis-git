Different shoes have different care needs, so to find out how your pair are best looked after, please see our <a href="shoe-care">Care Instructions guide</a>.</p>
                                                                    </div>

A natural shoe polish such as beeswax can be used to keep leather soft and protected to prevent scuffing and can also be used to reduce the appearance of light scuff marks and rejuvenate the overall appearance of leather. A colour-matched polish can be used to mask more prominent scuff marks. If you find your child’s shoes are showing excessive scuffing, this could be because they’re in shoes that aren’t suitable to their stage of development or their shoes don’t fit them correctly. If your child’s shoes are too big for them, the shoes are more likely to drag on the ground and cause your child to trip up. Refer to FAQ sections Ranges and Sizing to find out how you can make sure your child is in the best shoes for their feet. To find out more about how to look after your Bobux shoes, please refer to our <a href="shoe-care">Care Instructions guide</a>. </p>

A natural shoe polish such as beeswax can be used to keep leather soft and protected to prevent scuffing and can also be used to reduce the appearance of light scuff marks and rejuvenate the overall appearance of leather. A colour-matched polish can be used to mask more prominent scuff marks. If you find your child’s shoes are showing excessive scuffing, this could be because they’re in shoes that aren’t suitable to their stage of development or their shoes don’t fit them correctly. If your child’s shoes are too big for them, the shoes are more likely to drag on the ground and cause your child to trip up.
